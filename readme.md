*"Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that itâ€™s a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain."*

# My Language Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on Philosophy of Language, Cognitive Science, and formal models of Natural Language Semantics in particular. It also contains related programming experiments and reference-files (like PDFs).

There is no explicit goal to any of this, except to document my own thoughts and things I learn. Spending effort maintaining the overall structure of the notes will hopefully lead to better comprehension and memory.
