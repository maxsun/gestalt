## Categorical Grammar

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorial_grammar)

* Refers to formal grammars designed around the principles of compositionality.
* Similar to lambda calculus, except that rather than only having functions `A -> B`, Categorical Grammars have bi-directional functions such that `A\B` and `B\A` represent different phrasings of `A` and `B`.



## Church-Turing Thesis

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis)

* Hypothesizes that a function on the real numbers can only be computer if and only if it is also computable by a Turing Machine.
* A function is Turing-computable or lambda-computable if and only if it is "general recursive".



## Primitive Recursive Functions

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function)

Given by 5 axioms:

1. Constant function
2. Successor function
3. Projection function
4. Composition
5. Primitive recursion



## Process Calculus

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus)

* Refers to approaches to formally modelling concurent systems.
* Attempts to provide formal descriptions of communication and interactions between processes.
