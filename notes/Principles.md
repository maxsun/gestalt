Ideas to remember while attempting to model a language.



# Time & Space

Language is a form of information transmission.

Information is the resolution of uncertainty, therefore it requires a transition through states of uncertainty.

The states require space and the transition through states is time.

Therefore information requires time & space.

Therefore, it makes no sense to try and model language without Time and Space.



# Representation

Language requires some form of Representation; some manifestation to be interpreted. Sentences, words, and letters are all Representations. A book is also a Representation.

A language without a Representation is like a human without a body.



# Interpretation

The interpretation of language is a fundamental part of the language itself â€” one cannot exist without the other. This includes the idea of Context, as well as the computational abilities necessary to interpret the language.

The ability to make Reference requires computations to be context-sensitive; the meaning of an expression in language depends on the situation.

Functionally, Interpretation is a context-sensitive mapping from a representation to some other informative (structural) representation.

Additionally, Interpretation requires the ability to manipulate the context.
